Please provide specific and detailed responses of a reasonable length to allow for thorough assessment of your qualifications. Responses which state \"See Resume\" or \"See Application\" may be considered insufficient and therefore may not be scored.\nThe selection procedure will consist of the following examination:\n\nAn Application & Supplemental Questionnaire Appraisal Examination (weight 100%) will be conducted to evaluate each applicant's application and supplemental questionnaire for satisfaction of minimum qualifications (pass/not pass); and for educational coursework, training, experience, knowledge, and abilities which relate to this position.

Scores may be adjusted based on such factors as number of candidates, anticipated vacancies, past practice, and natural breaks in the scores achieved by this group of candidates.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nIt is the policy of law enforcement and legal offices and departments, in the County of Sonoma, that that job candidates complete a thorough background investigation process prior to employment. This policy is imperative in order to keep the department\u2019s employees and the public safe, and to maintain high standards in the law enforcement community. Candidates referred to departments for a selection interview are typically required to sign authorization and release forms enabling such an investigation. Failure to sign prescribed forms will result in the candidate not being considered further for that vacancy.

The investigation may include, but is not necessarily limited to: use of prescription and/or other drugs, reports from former employers, friends, family members, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, credit reports, court reports, public records search, and/or other relevant sources. Candidates must be honest and forthcoming about information that may arise during the background process. Deception during any portion of this process is grounds for disqualification, even after employment.\n\nDepending on the assignment, candidates may be required to take a pre-employment medical examination and may be required to take a polygraph examination. All candidates for law enforcement positions are required to undergo drug testing as part of the selection process. Additionally, candidates may be required to take a pre-employment psychological and physical abilities examination. The results of these examinations and the background investigation shall be confidential and shall not be available to the candidate for review. Failure to pass the background investigation will eliminate a candidate from the employment process. You may also review the Job Classification Screening Schedule to determine the requirements for this position.\n\nIssues that arise during the investigation process will be assessed and judgment and discretion will be used to determine the employability of the candidate. Where there is evidence of a candidate\u2019s past use of controlled substances, many factors shall be used to determine the employability of the individual such as pattern of use, kind of drug used, circumstances of the start of the drug use, treatment, behavior and attitude since discontinuance, etc. Please note that a history of using controlled substances does not result in automatic disqualification from the selection process. Prior to disqualifying any candidate whose profile falls within the provisions of the policy, the candidate shall be given the opportunity to present any and all evidence of mitigating facts which the candidate feels should be considered by the hiring authority.\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION: As the largest employer in Sonoma County, the Board of Supervisors has adopted a vaccination and testing policy to help mitigate transmission of COVID-19. All County employees will be required to either have documented proof of full COVID-19 vaccination (including booster, when eligible) on file or consent to twice weekly COVID-19 testing.\n\nHOW TO APPLY\n\nApplications are accepted on-line at: www.yourpath2sonomacounty.org.

We recognize the entrenched racism that exists within our public systems and the unjust impact this has had on families of color. Our aim is that children and families most impacted by systemic poverty and racism receive the multidisciplinary support they deserve to be well, learn, and thrive.\n\nLong-term, we hope to create a game-changing school model that can be replicated across the country. As we continue to learn and grow, we plan to share what we've learned and pursue policy and systems change on a local, state, and national level. We are proud to receive funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a major national philanthropy.\n\nOur approach has three defining characteristics:\n\nWe start early. We start working with children as young as 8 months and provide full-time school starting at age three to reach them at a critical stage in development.\nWe partner with parents. We believe that when parents thrive, children thrive, so we support the wellness and growth of parents alongside the growth of their children.\nWe integrate services. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.\n\nIn 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four year olds. We have grown to serve over 300 children and their families through a birth to three program, parent wellness program, full-day preschool, and elementary school, which will grow through eighth grade. In 2020, we began programming at our second site in Hayward, California.\n\nABOUT OUR EAST PALO ALTO SITE\n\nWe are continuing to grow our East Palo Alto site and are excited to launch 5th grade for our 2022-2023 school year. In our school we currently serve ~250 students across two preschool grades (3 and 4 year olds), kindergarten, first grade, second grade and third grade. Beyond school, core components of our model include partnering closely with parents throughout their child's development and supporting parent wellness; coordinating early screening and developmental support; and working with existing health care providers in the community to coordinate care for children.\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nThe Lead Upper Elementary Humanities Teacher reports to the Principal and is responsible for planning and delivering rigorous, relevant instruction in humanities.
