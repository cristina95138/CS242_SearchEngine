Work from home, work from the beach, work from the office; it's up to you.While we facilitate the exchange of money and documents, writers and clients message each other directly to ensure clear expectations.

Our QA team reviews the order to ensure it meets order requirements before sending it to the client, or back to the writer for adjustments. Sometimes the queues are abundant while other times they may seem bare. We find many freelancers like to use this position to earn extra money between their regular daily tasks, whether it be managing the household, working a standard 9-5, or going to classes. It's a great way to determine if the freelance writer lifestyle is right for you.
