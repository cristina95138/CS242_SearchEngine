Work from home, work from the beach, work from the office; it's up to you.While we facilitate the exchange of money and documents, writers and clients message each other directly to ensure clear expectations.

Our QA team reviews the order to ensure it meets order requirements before sending it to the client, or back to the writer for adjustments. Sometimes the queues are abundant while other times they may seem bare. We find many freelancers like to use this position to earn extra money between their regular daily tasks, whether it be managing the household, working a standard 9-5, or going to classes. It's a great way to determine if the freelance writer lifestyle is right for you.

Three rescued Boston Terriers are the inspiration for the name behind what has evolved into Michigan\u2019s first \u201cBarlor\u201d. It all started with the idea of creating a food & ice cream experience with quality ingredients that both humans and their pets could enjoy.After our beginnings as an artisan ice cream parlor, we got a little crazy and added a bar and a restaurant. Our ice cream is hand-made in small batches of six gallons or less at a time. All of our bakery items are made from scratch, with no mixes or pre-packaged items. Our bar focuses on cocktails inspired by Michigan spirits, while our food follows the creativeness of the ice cream and cocktails by putting interesting twists on classic bar food.Combining ingredients that don\u2019t generally get put together has proven interesting, but we pull it all together by incorporating an adult theme across the menu calling it \u201cyour childhood on the rocks.\u201dWe take a \u201cteam-to-table\u201d approach to put a unique twist on classic bar food that we\u2019re truly passionate about. When we say \u201chandcrafted\u201d, we mean it: using local products, hand cutting our fries in-house, slicing our own cheeses, and making our sauces from scratch are just a few examples. Every ingredient has a purpose on our menu and quality defines what we do.We currently have three locations with more to come!Here are a few reasons you\u2019ll love working with us: Fun and welcoming teamCreativity is encouragedWe\u2019re not open on HolidaysLots of room for advancementLook for us to be featured on the Food Network this fall!:  Browndog recently completed filming with the Food Network.
