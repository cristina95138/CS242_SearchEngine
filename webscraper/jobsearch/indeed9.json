Over 5,000 educators have contributed to the development of the Smarter Balanced system by providing suggestions for how the Consortium can better help them help their students. In addition, educators write and review test questions and instructional resources to ensure they are fair and accessible to learners. With a membership that collectively serves over 6 million students and spanning 15 states/territories, this member-led organization will continue to have an important role to play in preparing students for successful and productive futures.\n\nWith such compelling offerings and with the organization's deep and abiding commitment to supporting student learning, this is an auspicious time for Smarted Balanced-an organization that will continue to innovate and double down on its commitment to inclusivity, diversity, and accessibility.

Smarter Balanced is housed at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Silicon Valley Extension.\n\nOur work is guided by the belief that a high-quality assessment system can provide information and tools for teachers and schools to improve instruction and help students succeed - regardless of disability, language, or subgroup. We involve experienced educators, researchers, state and local policymakers, and community groups working together in a transparent and consensus-driven process.\n\nSmarter Balanced staff have a profound commitment to UCSC's Principles of Community (see Addendum B below) including embracing diversity, equity and inclusion. We believe a diverse team that reflects the educators and students we serve can create the best solutions to serve them.\n\nUCSC Extension provides professional training that reflects the academic rigor of the University of California and the hands-on, roll-up-your-shirtsleeves practicality of Silicon Valley culture.
