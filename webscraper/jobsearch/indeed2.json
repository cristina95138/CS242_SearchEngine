They bring their best selves to work each day and are very adaptable and coachable. They approach each challenge with a positive attitude and a determination to work through anything.\nWhat is the team like?\nYou will be part of a small but vitally important IT team, including our other two IT admins, our two system administrators, the IT manager, and yourself.

If you do not qualify based on education or experience alone, you can combine your education and experience by converting each to a percentage and then adding the percentages. To calculate this, determine your total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required; then determine your education as a percentage of the education required; then add the two percentages.

NOTE: If more than 10 percent of your undergraduate course work (credit hours) was taken on a pass/fail or similar basis, your claim must be based on class standing or membership in an honor society.\n\nOR\n\nD. Combination of graduate level education and specialized experience. If you have some but not all of the experience or education described above, you may still qualify by combining the amount of creditable experience and education that you do have.

We decided this just wouldn't do.\n\nWe understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done.
