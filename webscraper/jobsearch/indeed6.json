The organization's dynamic system of tools includes tools for statewide improvement as well as tools to improve teaching and learning. Over 5,000 educators have contributed to the development of the Smarter Balanced system by providing suggestions for how the Consortium can better help them help their students. In addition, educators write and review test questions and instructional resources to ensure they are fair and accessible to learners. With a membership that collectively serves over 6 million students and spanning 15 states/territories, this member-led organization will continue to have an important role to play in preparing students for successful and productive futures.\n\nWith such compelling offerings and with the organization's deep and abiding commitment to supporting student learning, this is an auspicious time for Smarted Balanced-an organization that will continue to innovate and double down on its commitment to inclusivity, diversity, and accessibility. It is within this context that Smarter Balanced invites applications for the role of Executive Administrative Officer - a position that will give a dynamic leader the opportunity to have an indelible impact on the next chapter of the organization's evolution.\n\nWhile all candidates are encouraged to apply and, in so doing, share how they see themselves adding value to the Smarter Balanced environment, the following credentials and/or experiences are seen as possible markers of the candidates most likely to realize success in this role: A) demonstrated experience leading and being responsive to a diversity of stakeholder needs, preferably gained from working in an educational and/or nonprofit environment, or work experience that demonstrates a strong appreciation for working with a plurality of stakeholders who have a diverse set of needs; B) experience leading complex cross organizational projects as well as experience with planning and budgeting; C) demonstrated experience leading innovation and change; D); an advanced degree in a field related to the position of interest and/or the equivalent combination of experience and training; and, E) the ability to build deep and meaningful relationships and work cooperatively and collaboratively with others.\n\nThe Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) is a public agency supported by 15 members (13 states, one territory and the Bureau of Indian Education). Through the work of thousands of educators, Smarter Balanced created an online assessment system aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), as well as tools for educators to improve teaching and learning. Smarter Balanced is housed at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Silicon Valley Extension.\n\nOur work is guided by the belief that a high-quality assessment system can provide information and tools for teachers and schools to improve instruction and help students succeed - regardless of disability, language, or subgroup. We involve experienced educators, researchers, state and local policymakers, and community groups working together in a transparent and consensus-driven process.\n\nSmarter Balanced staff have a profound commitment to UCSC's Principles of Community (see Addendum B below) including embracing diversity, equity and inclusion.
