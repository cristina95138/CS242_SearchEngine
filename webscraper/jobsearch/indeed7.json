Their main duties include hiring and training Subcontractors, applying for the necessary licenses and building permits and providing hands-on supervision and guidance to workers on the site. General Contractor Duties and Responsibilities The General Contractor has a wide range of duties and is uniquely responsible for the entire build. A few duties a General Contractor may be responsible for include: Keep the project on the appropriate timeline. Delays can cause finance issues or result in unfortunate weather timing if the build is spanning multiple seasons. The General Contractor is directly responsible for ensuring a quality build within the quoted timeframe.  Manage subcontractors and labor related to the job. Skilled laborers will often need to complete portions of the project, including plumbing, electrical and carpentry. While the General Contractor may have the appropriate certifications in some of these areas, and may take on some of the work, it could be necessary to hire others to complete the project. Order materials related to the build and work with the vendors to ensure the correct deliveries are taking place according to the timeline. A delay in any key element can cause the entire project to sit idle while waiting for its arrival. The General Contractor will be in constant contact with wholesalers and supply stores in order to properly stock the site.  Communicate status of the project throughout the build with the client and other pertinent parties. What Does a General Contractor Do? General Contractors work for construction or development companies organizing and implementing construction projects for certain properties. They often arrive at the construction site each day to help the employees complete tasks and to ensure everyone follows proper safety guidelines. General Contractors may also be responsible for staying within a strict budget for hiring employees and purchasing construction materials. They also act as the main point of contact between the client and Construction Workers.

The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:\n\n- Professional registration - Current registration as a professional engineer by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.\n- Written Test- Evidence of having successfully passed the Engineer-in-Training (EIT) examination, or the written test required for professional registration, which is administered by the Boards of Engineering Examiners in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.\n\nApplicants who have passed the EIT examination and have completed all the requirements for either (a) a bachelor's degree in engineering technology (BET) from an accredited college of university that included 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences, or (b) a BET from a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) may be rated eligible for certain engineering positions at GS-5.

Applicants for positions that involve highly technical research, development, or similar functions requiring an advanced level of competence in basic science must meet the basic requirements in paragraph A.\n\nBecause of the diversity in kind and quality of BET programs, graduates of other BET programs are required to complete at least 1 year of additional education or highly technical work experience of such nature as to provide reasonable assurance of the possession of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for professional engineering competence. The adequacy of this background must be demonstrated by passing the EIT examination.\n\n- Specified academic courses - Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and in engineering that included the courses specified in the basic requirements. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of a professional engineering curriculum as described in paragraph A.\n\n- Related curriculum - Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in engineering technology or in an appropriate professional field, e.g., physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions.
