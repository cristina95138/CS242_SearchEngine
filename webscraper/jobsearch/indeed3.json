As the market began to shift towards new technologies, it was clear to them that e-commerce would be the next forefront for the tire industry and wanted to create a solution that would incorporate private businesses.\nIn 2012, our co-founders successfully converted the traditional business model into a technology-driven model, which linked independent tire distributors across the country into one seamless e-commerce network, creating SimpleTire.\nToday, our network stretches across the country with 10,000+ installers and 3,000+ independent supply points. We employ hundreds of people, support thousands of local businesses, and strive to empower everyone along the process.\nWe employ 110+ people in our headquarters located in the greater Philadelphia area.

As a leading school in online herbal education, we serve thousands of students, primarily in the U.S., although about 10% of our students are international. Our team of twelve and growing mainly works remotely, but a few folks work side-by-side with our Founder and Director, Juliet Blankespoor, in her home in Asheville, NC.The school is in a period of growth in anticipation of Juliet\u2019s forthcoming book in April 2022--we\u2019re expanding our team and course offerings and considering the possibility of product development.We also create regular free content through our Herbal Holiday Guide, Handcrafted Herbalism Mini-Course, Instagram (www.instagram.com/chestnutschoolherbs), Facebook (www.facebook.com/chestnutschoolherbs), Blog Castanea (www.chestnutherbs.com/blog), and Budding Herbalist Guide. Feel free to check out our team (https://chestnutherbs.com/about/team-chestnut/) and our instructors (www.chestnutherbs.com/about/instructors).OUR VALUES AND CULTUREOur reason for being: We connect people with plants and the earth through teaching about herbalism and the empowerment of bioregional herbal medicine. These connections are foundational for a sense of place and, in turn, nurture reverence and responsibility for the planet\u2019s health. Through a kinship with one\u2019s community, we hope to inspire our students to actively work toward social and racial justice and reduce health care disparities. We champion social justice, women\u2019s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, anti-racism, equity, and measures and practices that promote planetary health through our educational materials, social media, community giving, scholarships, and partnerships. Our nonprofit partners in the field of food and medicine justice award scholarships that we donate to people who work in communities organizing for collective liberation. We also offer over 250 need-based diversity scholarships annually. Please read our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Anti-Racism Statement (www.chestnutherbs.com/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-antiracism-statement) to learn about where we are and where we\u2019re heading.Work-Life Balance: We don\u2019t f*#$ around when it comes to self-care, rest, or rejuvenation. We are a small, tight-knit team, and we want our employees to happily stay with us until they retire (or their dreams call them elsewhere). We promote wholeness through careful planning (to spread the load and minimize tight deadlines) and by offering six weeks of paid vacation/sick leave, plus paid parental leave, a health care stipend, and a green 401-K. We invest in each team member\u2019s professional development and require monthly diversity, equity, and anti-racism training. We also contribute to our employee\u2019s financial well-being by offering above-average salaries and profit-sharing bonuses. Our leadership team understands, exemplifies, and prioritizes flexibility in balancing work with the care of our families and our emotional and physical health.Communication:  We practice clear, direct, and compassionate communication with each other and the public. Our sweet spot is the intersection between kindness and radical honesty. We err on the side of overcommunication to reduce misunderstandings and increase team cohesion. Our leadership team is open to feedback and gives regular employee reviews with meaningful dialogue. We are all in this to grow personally and professionally, and to do this, we foster humility, vulnerability, and compassionate, active listening. We acknowledge that our decision-making is stronger and more informed by listening to diverse perspectives, not just the voices of those in power. We aim to cultivate a culture where it is OK for everyone (not just those in power) to question assumptions, goals, methods, and perspectives and for others to listen with humility, vulnerability, and openness.Silliness, Beauty, and Personality Keep Things Lively:  Our high-quality educational materials are filled with beauty, inspiration, humor, and clear instruction. We know online learning is inherently challenging, so we engage all types of learners through diverse media and content review. If you think muppet GIFS, emojis, setting intentions, and interoffice cursing are unprofessional or off-putting, we\u2019re not your peeps.Attention to Detail:  The Chestnut School team runs a tight ship: we prioritize professionalism. This means we focus on a smaller number of high-quality endeavors rather than completing a slew of mediocre projects. Sloppiness and shoddy work are not how we roll--this means we spend lots of time on editing, processes, checking each other\u2019s work, and overcommunication. This doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t fudge up. Instead, we have each other\u2019s backs to catch the inevitable mistakes, missteps, misunderstandings, or oversights. And we give ourselves the time to plan, plant, prune, and weed each and every project.Overdelivering: We are a high-touch company, prioritizing student support through technical and instructional assistance. Our students are ALWAYS our top priority, and our reputation is a testimony to our integrity in timely communication and overdelivering. Our pricing reflects the quality of our work and our top-tier customer service.Impeccable Integrity: We are diehards for attribution and reciprocity. Our culture thrives on honesty, personal responsibility, and discretion. We have a zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism. Our standards for attribution are clearly outlined in handbook form for our team, as well as for guest writers, teachers, and contributors.POSITION DESCRIPTIONThe Chestnut School of Herbal Medicine is looking for a responsible, creative, organized, and fun person to join our team to provide personal and administrative support in a well-organized and timely manner. You\u2019ll primarily be working one-on-one with Juliet Blankespoor (Director/Owner: https://chestnutherbs.com/about/team-chestnut/#juliet_blankespoor) across various projects that impact her both personally and professionally. Your work is primarily fulfilled onsite in a home office with some remote work from your home office, along with some local off-site travel. The Director currently lives in West Asheville but will hopefully be moving to another home 20 minutes from Asheville within the year.This position is for someone who thrives in a dynamic setting and enjoys a diverse set of projects and tasks that change daily. You are often described as a go-getter, and you want to roll your sleeves up to get the job done. You\u2019re a curious person who likes to research how to do something you\u2019re not familiar with. You have excellent judgment about whether it\u2019s optimal to do something yourself or outsource a project. You welcome change and the challenge of distilling chaos into order.You have a high degree of emotional intelligence and can easily work alongside someone who is ambitious, intuitive, assertive, sensitive, passionate, and particular. You prioritize self-reflection and personal growth and welcome those qualities in work colleagues. Your number one priority is to make Juliet\u2019s life easier and smoother by taking on any tasks\u2013or outsourcing projects\u2013that don\u2019t need her attention. You see yourself as generally competent and highly self-sufficient and are comfortable working alongside a driven woman who values loyalty and discretion.You prefer a tidy environment, relish order, and naturally fluff pillows and fold throws. You regularly go to town on disheveled corners and drawers. Dust bunnies feel like demonic beings capable of toppling all household equanimity. If your car often has trash on the floor and you lose your water bottle every few months, this position probably isn\u2019t a good fit. You have worked in fast-paced environments before and like a dynamic and productive workspace.You enjoy working with a team and are comfortable receiving feedback and direction from other team members in a highly supportive and collaborative environment. If you react to constructive criticism with deflection and blame and dig your heels in, this position isn\u2019t for you. If you cultivate the necessary humility for self-reflection and see feedback as an opportunity for growth (even when it\u2019s hard and sucks), you\u2019ll be right at home.You also thrive working alone, and you\u2019re self-motivated and a creative problem solver. You are incredibly detail-oriented and love to create and hone organizational systems. You\u2019re patient, compassionate, and naturally helpful. Clear communication is essential to you, and you know how to ask for help and clarification when needed. You are adept at giving and receiving regular feedback.This position includes daily check-ins with the Director, weekly check-ins with other staff and contractors, monthly team meetings and racial equity trainings, and daily digital communication with team members.Chestnut School also has annual team retreats in Asheville, NC (subject to change, depending on COVID-considerations).

You not only anticipate; you collaborate, accommodate, coordinate, communicate, and calculate what needs to get done on a daily basis with a rare combination of warmth, confidence, and efficiency that makes you the central nervous system of the executive suite.\nAt Vital Farms, we\u2019re looking for an Executive Assistant to the Senior Leadership Team who are not only passionate about their work and who strive for perfection, but who also see how their day-to-day efforts have the ability to create an impact on a much larger scale.\nThat\u2019s because at Vital Farms, we\u2019re on a mission to change the food industry one ethically sourced ingredient at a time.
