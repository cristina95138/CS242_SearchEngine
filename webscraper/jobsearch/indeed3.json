As the market began to shift towards new technologies, it was clear to them that e-commerce would be the next forefront for the tire industry and wanted to create a solution that would incorporate private businesses.\nIn 2012, our co-founders successfully converted the traditional business model into a technology-driven model, which linked independent tire distributors across the country into one seamless e-commerce network, creating SimpleTire.\nToday, our network stretches across the country with 10,000+ installers and 3,000+ independent supply points. We employ hundreds of people, support thousands of local businesses, and strive to empower everyone along the process.\nWe employ 110+ people in our headquarters located in the greater Philadelphia area.
